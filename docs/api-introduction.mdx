# API Documentation

The Chatbot API provides a set of endpoints for managing chat functionality, user authentication, administrative tasks, and now continent-related data.

## Base URL

## Authentication

Most API endpoints require authentication. Include the authentication token in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

## API Endpoints

The API is organized into the following categories:

- `/api/auth/*` – Authentication endpoints
- `/api/chat/*` – Chat functionality
- `/api/users/*` – User management
- `/api/users/stats/*` – User statistics
- `/api/continents/*` – Continent data (e.g., `/api/continents/:id` to fetch a specific continent)
- `/api/continents/stats/*` – Continent statistics (requires authentication)

For detailed information about specific endpoints, see their respective documentation pages.
