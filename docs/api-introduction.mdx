# API Documentation

The Chatbot API provides a set of endpoints for managing chat functionality, user authentication, group and user management, and administrative tasks.

## Base URL

```
https://your-domain.com/api
```

## Authentication

Most API endpoints require authentication. Include the authentication token in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Some endpoints—such as the **Group Statistics** endpoint—additionally require a valid session. If a request is made without a session, the server will respond with `401 Unauthorized`.

## API Endpoints

The API is organized into the following categories:

- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints
- `/api/chat/*` - Chat functionality
- `/api/users/*` - User management
- `/api/users/stats/*` - User statistics
- `/api/groups/*` - Group management
- `/api/groups/stats/*` - Group statistics

For detailed information about specific endpoints, see their respective documentation pages.
